# A Typical Day in Singapore

8:00 AM

I wake up as the lawn mower goes off. "Wroooooom.." I think to myself: "Why do they always mow the lawn at 8 in the morning?" As I turn around to try and snooze a bit, I feel that my skin is oily and sticky again. Despite having showered last night before going to bed, my skin is always sticky. Singapore's weather is just *always* hot and humid, there is no escape.

I turn up the fan on the ceiling, which is constantly operating. We don't have an air conditioner in the room, we cool our bodies down purely with the wind from the fan.

9:00 AM

When I leave the house to go to the outdoor fitness area, the sun is already shining bright and hot. I see *aunties and uncles* engaging in some form of exercise, whether it be running, briskly walking or some form of ballsport (it looks a bit like tennis but on a badminton court with a certin type of rackets). I do a quick run around the park, sweatpearls already forming after just a few minutes of running. The only time that one can do exercise in Singapore really are the early morning hours, or the evening hours. During the day it is just too hot. 

I decide to leave the park and run around the block. Every block of the *HDBs* looks the same to me. They all reach many levels into the sky, are colored in similar ways, with poles sticking out for hanging laundry.

10:00 AM

12:00 PM - LUNCH TIME  

My stomach starts to tell me that it's lunch time. Ever since coming to Singapore, I have stopped eating breakfast and instead have lunch and dinner as my main meals of the day. 

Zhenghong asks me: "What do we want to get? *Dabao* or dine-in?". "Let's dine-in", I say, "*dabao* makes food go soggy. I also want to make use of the "going-out" experience as much as I can, ever since Singapore has allowed dining-in again. After a period of COVID-19 restrictions, this bit of freedom has finally returned again, a small luxury all Singaporeans care deeply about.

We walk the 5 minutes to our usual *coffeeshop* at Block 165, a collection of foodstalls with a common eating area. From afar, we can already see the people queing for the supposedly famous "Kekoumian" stall. It serves instant noodles in a seafood or meat broth, amongst other things. We think it is overhyped. But then again, Singaporeans don't seem to mind queuing when it comes to good food.

I look around the stalls, watching friends, couples, families with children and people in army uniforms eat their lunch. "What am I feeling like today?", I ask myself. Rice or Noodles? Seafood or Veggie? Spicy or not? *Caifan* is always a good option when I cannot decide, since it has everything: Carbs in form of rice, protein, veggies. You just point at the dishes you want and they assemble it for you. 

But today I feel like having noodles rather than rice. In the end, Zhenghong and I go for *Mala*, the customizeable stir-fry pot. We choose the usual: lotus root, leafy vegetables, mushrooms, cheese tofu, quail eggs, seafood, meat and noodles. He tells the staff to do it with "Mild spice, less oil". Whether or not they actually use less oil is still an open question to me. A lot of food here is quite oily, and this is not necessarily an exception. 

Our lunch cost amounts to 18 SGD, roughly 11 Euros for two people. And this is considered to be on the pricier end for a coffeeshop meal. 

2:00 PM

After lunch, we always feel like having a drink. I go to the coffeeshop opposite of the HDB to the stall that serves the drinks (there is always one at every coffeeshop and it is usually the one with the highest profit margin). The auntie at the coffeeshop looks at me, in expectation of my order. I give the usual order for Zhenghong and me and say to her: "*Teh C Siew Siew Dai Bing, Teh C Kosong Bing, he de*".

She pours the tea in the plastic bags full of ice, hands it over to me with a string so I can carry it back. I give Zhenghong his drink, and after the first sip he approvingly says "Good, not too sweet."

5:00 PM


End of the work day.
