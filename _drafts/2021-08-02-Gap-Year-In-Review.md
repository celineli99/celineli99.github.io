After graduating from Oxford in summer 2020, I took a year out from university and academic life. I deliberately did not go down the "easy" route of just continuing with a Master's. Instead, I decided to pursue internships, to get an idea of potential work sectors in the future, do some travelling (as much as the pandemic permitted) 

My motivation and willingness to do this gap year had already formed throughout my studies. It was around the middle of my second year that I knew I wanted to explore something else before continuing with my studies. It was a very "gut-feel" decision (by that I mean that my gut told me it was right), but it also made sense to me: Since I started my Bachelor's at the age of 17, I graduated when I was 20, which is younger compared to many of my peers. This meant that I had the luxury of taking the time to explore what I really wanted. I feel lucky and privileged to be in that position and wanted to use this chance to the fullest.
