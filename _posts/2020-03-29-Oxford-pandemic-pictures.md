The COVID-19 pandemic is having far-reaching consequences, as we are all aware. One of the most visible ones are the empty cities and towns, which usually would be filled with residents, tourists and shoppers.

I decided against moving back to my parents' place in the midst of the pandemic. Instead, I decided to stay at Oxford to sit my final exams.

When I went to college one day, a porter said to me, "now would be the perfect time to take postcard-like pictures of all these famous landmarks, since no one is around!". That inspired me to actually go around Oxford city centre and capture some of the landmarks in a highly unusual emptiness.

The entrance to the inner quad of the Bodleian Library - with shut doors.

![radcliffe square](../assets/img/2020/IMG_8362.JPG)
Radcliffe Square - normally there would be lines and lines of tourists posting here in front of the Radcliffe Camera.

Since 17th of March the libraries in Oxford are closed.

![high street](../assets/img/2020/IMG_8370.JPG)
A very rare sight: Almost empty High Street without buses and cars. (very pleasant for cyclists like me)

![cornmarket st](../assets/img/2020/IMG_8377.JPG)
Normally busy and bustling, Cornmarket St without opened shops is very desolate.


![mc do](../assets/img/2020/IMG_8379.JPG)
Even Mc Donald has closed its shops.

![ship st](../assets/img/2020/IMG_8382.JPG)
You cannot hear it, but the wind was making the sign "No 1" squiek, adding to the atmosphere of an empty street.

![eat and drink](../assets/img/2020/IMG_8387.JPG)
More like "Eat, drink and be socially distancing

![westgate](../assets/img/2020/IMG_8393.JPG)
Big shopping mall Westgate - without customers.

The Broad street is broadly empty.
