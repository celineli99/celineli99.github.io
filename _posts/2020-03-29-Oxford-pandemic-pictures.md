The COVID-19 pandemic is having far-reaching consequences, as we are all aware. One of the most visible ones are the empty cities and towns, which usually would be filled with residents, tourists and shoppers.

As one porter from my college said to me, "now would be the perfect time to take postcard-like pictures of all these famous landmarks, since no one is around!". That inspired me to actually go around Oxford city centre and capture some of the landmarks in a highly unusual emptiness.

\[caption id="attachment\_1143" align="alignnone" width="5184"\]![IMG_8357](images/img_8357.jpg) The entrance to the inner quad of the Bodleian Library - with shut doors.\[/caption\]

\[caption id="attachment\_1145" align="alignnone" width="3456"\]![IMG_8362](images/img_8362.jpg) Radcliffe Square - normally there would be lines and lines of tourists posting here in front of the Radcliffe Camera.\[/caption\]

\[caption id="attachment\_1146" align="alignnone" width="3456"\]![IMG_8364](images/img_8364.jpg) Since 17th of March the libraries in Oxford are closed.\[/caption\]

\[caption id="attachment\_1147" align="alignnone" width="5184"\]![IMG_8370](images/img_8370.jpg) A very rare sight: Almost empty High Street without buses and cars. (very pleasant for cyclists like me)\[/caption\]

\[caption id="attachment\_1148" align="alignnone" width="5184"\]![IMG_8377](images/img_8377.jpg) Normally busy and bustling, Cornmarket St without opened shops is very desolate.\[/caption\]

\[caption id="attachment\_1149" align="alignnone" width="5184"\]![IMG_8379](images/img_8379.jpg) Even Mc D's closed its shops!\[/caption\]

\[caption id="attachment\_1150" align="alignnone" width="3456"\]![IMG_8382](images/img_8382.jpg) You cannot hear it, but the wind was making the sign "No 1" squiek, adding to the atmosphere of an empty street.\[/caption\]

\[caption id="attachment\_1151" align="alignnone" width="5184"\]![IMG_8387](images/img_8387.jpg) More like "Eat, drink and be socially distancing"\[/caption\]

\[caption id="attachment\_1152" align="alignnone" width="5184"\]![IMG_8393](images/img_8393.jpg) Big shopping mall Westgate - without customers.\[/caption\]

\[caption id="attachment\_1153" align="alignnone" width="5184"\]![IMG_8394](images/img_8394.jpg) Broad Street, broadly empty.\[/caption\]
