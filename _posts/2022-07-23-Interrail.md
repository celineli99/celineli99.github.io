# Overview

In summer 2022, I traveled for 31 days in 7 countries and 13 different cities in the Central European region. My main motivation for this trip was that I wanted to get to know our “European neighbours”, to the East of Germany. Growing up, we usually went to Italy, France or Spain for a vacation but rarely to Poland, Slovakia or Slovenia. So I wanted to educate myself about the region, get to know its culture, its diversity of languages, the food and the people. 

My main mode of transport was the train, because I bought an Interrail pass which allowed me to hop on any train in Europe in 2 months. It has a convenient App with which I could generated my train tickets, also shortly before the train departure. I occasionally used buses where train was the less convenient option.

I traveled alone, but I was never *lonely*. I always met people on the way, during walking tours or in hostels. I also visited friends in various locations. Maria in her hometown in Slovakia, Andy in Vienna, Mislav and Anthea in Croatia. This added to the “authenticity” of those places, knowing someone who is from there or has lived there for a while.

Traveling at the right pace is a challenge. For me the “golden middle” was somewhere around 3-5 days in each location or country. This allowed me to visit a variety of places, but still maintaining a sustainable pace that doesn’t exhaust me. I try to avoid touristic places with a lot of people like the plague. Crowds make me uncomfortable and I cannot enjoy the sights at all.

Central European places are cheaper, on average, than living costs in Germany but also not by a *lot*. Especially those countries which have the Euro as currency (Slovenia, Slovakia) were not that different in living costs. On average, I spent around 25 Euros per day on food.

Food culture in Central Europe didn’t overwhelm me (I tried about 16 different types of cabbage stews and dumplings), apart from a few exceptions. Krakow was excellent for good & international food for decent prices, and Croatia had great mediterranean cuisine with lots of seafood which I love.
