In summer 2019, I had the chance to be close to the Alpians mountains, by staying for 2 months in Munich in the South of Germany, and afterwards travelling Switzerland and South Tyrol in northern Italy. This gave me the wonderful opportunity to go on day hikes through beautiful sceneries. Some photo impressions can be found below.
