These are my revision notes from my undergraduate studies of Philosophy, Politics and Economics. I created the summary sheets and used them for my PPE Final exams in summer 2020. The three Politics modules I took exams in are: Poltical Theory, International Relations and Advanced Paper in Theories of Justice.

If you are an incoming Finalist, feel free to use these for your reference and as a complementing resource for your own material. But be mindful of double-checking sources and critically evaluating the arguments made, as these documents are prone to human error.

## Content of each summary sheet

I structured the summary sheets as follows:
- **Exam Strategies**: What to look out for during an exam, from personal experience and advice from tutors and previous finalists
- **My own position**: This is my stance on the topic after I had made most notes in the document and thought deeply about the topic. I found it important to include, because a good exam essay has a strong thesis statement and makes a convincing argument. For speaking with an authoritative voice, one needs to have a consolidated position on the topic. You are of course invited to disagree!
- **Definitions, Clarifications**: Rough explanation of important terms of the debate, what is fundamentally about etc. But be mindful that some definitions are subject to debate!
- **Subtopics of the debate**: "mapping the landscape" --> these are the main issues that fall under the broad topic
- **Main Authors and their works** for reference

**Some more context**: It is advisable in any Politics module to carefully choose a few topics (4-5) to revise in-depth. You will want to choose more than three, even if you only have to write three essays. This is because examiners might combine topics together in one question, in which case it is good to still have "back-ups". Cross-referencing material from different topics can also be a good idea, as long as you don't repeat the same arguments in multiple essays!
