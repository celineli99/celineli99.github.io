## Hi there!

I am Celine, a recent graduate of Oxford university, where I read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). I specialized in Econometrics, Behavioural Economics and International Relations.

With a Chinese cultural background, I grew up in Germany and speak both German and Mandarin as native languages. I am interested in work that addresses the climate crisis. In my future work, I wish to combine my interest in climate, energy and sustainability with my China background.

## Me Now

I am currently based in Singapore. I took a gap year after graduation to do two internships, one at Sinolytics, a China-specialized consultancy firm based in Berlin and another in the ifo economic research institute in Munich. Now I am working on a freelance basis for said China-specialized consultancy as well as for the project Sino-German Energy Partnership under the GIZ China.

I plan to move to Geneva in September 2021, to commence a 6-month internship at the United Nations Environment Programme.
