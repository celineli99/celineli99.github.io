## Hi there!

I am Celine, a recent graduate of Oxford university, where I read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). I specialized in Econometrics, Behavioural Economics and International Relations.

With a Chinese cultural background, I grew up in Germany and speak both German and Mandarin as native languages. I am interested in working in organizations that focus on China and climate sustainability. 

## Me Now

I am currently based in Singapore. I took a gap year after graduation to do two internships, one at Sinolytics, a China-specialized consultancy firm based in Berlin and another in the ifo economic research institute in Munich. Now I am working on a freelance basis for said China-specialized consultancy as well as for the GIZ China.

I plan to study a year in China at Sichuan university from September 2021 onwards.
