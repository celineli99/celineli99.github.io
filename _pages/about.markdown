## Hi there!

I am Celine, a recent graduate of Oxford university, where I read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). I specialized in Econometrics, Behavioural Economics and International Relations.

With a Chinese cultural background, I grew up in Germany and speak both German and Mandarin as native languages. I am interested in work that addresses the climate crisis. In my future work, I wish to combine my interest in climate, energy and sustainability with my China background.

## Me Now

I am currently based in Geneva, working with the United Nations Environment Programme. I took a gap year after graduation to do work in China- and climate-adjascent sectors. I worked at Sinolytics, a China-specialized consultancy firm based in Berlin, the ifo economic research institute in Munich as well as with the Sino-German Energy Partnership hosted by GIz China. 

I plan to commence my Master's studies in fall 2022.
