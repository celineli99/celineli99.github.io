## Hi there!

I am Celine, a recent graduate of Oxford university, where I read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). I specialized in Econometrics, Behavioural Economics and International Relations.

After graduating from PPE in 2020, I worked for two years in China- and climate-adjascent sectors, both in the public and private sector. Most recently, I worked as a consultant with the United Nations Environment Programme. Prior to this, I worked at Sinolytics, a China-specialized consultancy firm based in Berlin, the ifo economic research institute in Munich as well as with the Sino-German Energy Partnership hosted by GIZ China. 

Growing up in Southern Germany with a Chinese cultural background, I have always enjoyed bridging cultures. I am fluent in German, Mandarin, English and French. I am interested in work that addresses the climate crisis. In my future work, I wish to combine my interest in climate, energy and sustainability with my China background.

## Me Now

I am currently a 1st year Master's student in Economics at the [Graduate Institute Geneva](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/academic-departments/international-economics/our-master-programme). If you don't see me in the library, I am probably hiking in the mountains near Geneva.
