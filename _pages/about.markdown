## Hi there!

I am Celine, a recent graduate of Oxford university, where I read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE). I specialized in Econometrics, Behavioural Economics and International Relations.

With a Chinese cultural background, I grew up in Germany and speak both German and Mandarin as native languages. I am interested in working in organizations that focus on China and climate sustainability. 

## Me Now

I am currently based in Munich, Germany. I took a gap year after graduation to do two internships, one in a China-consultancy and another in an economic research institute.

Right now, I spend my time self-studying (web development, Chinese history and language) and spending time with my two little nieces. I am also trying out a lot of new cooking recipes!
